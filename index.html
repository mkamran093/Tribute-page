        >Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was an acclaimed inventor, electrical
        engineer, and physicist who played a vital role in the development of
        modern AC electrical power systems. Born in Croatia, Tesla received his
        education in engineering and physics in Europe before relocating to the
        United States. While initially collaborating with Thomas Edison, their
        differing views led to Tesla pursuing his own projects. Notably, he made
        groundbreaking contributions to AC power transmission and distribution
        by introducing the concept of the rotating magnetic field. Tesla held
        numerous patents, including the Tesla coil used in wireless power
        transfer and radio technology. He also explored wireless power
        transmission, wireless communication, and X-ray technology. Despite
        financial difficulties, Tesla's genius and forward-thinking continue to
        inspire scientists and engineers. His legacy as a brilliant inventor and
        pioneer in electrical power systems endures, shaping the modern
        world.</span
